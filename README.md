Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/oneflix/mkdljjcpkdmnpnecoenmcblbamiofeph) to stop binging by only letting you watch one episode at a time

Firefox doesn't work - waiting on [`window.navigation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigation#browser_compatibility) support.

## Works for:

-   Netflix
-   Disney+
-   BBC iPlayer

If the extension doesn't work on any of these then please [email me](mailto:joe@joeherbert.dev?subject=Oneflix).

If you'd like to request support for any other streaming services then please [email me](mailto:joe@joeherbert.dev?subject=New%20Streaming%20Service%20Support%20Request&body=Please%20add%20support%20for%3A%20).

## To do:

-   Install, update and uninstall pages on website
-   Support for other streaming sites - BBC iPlayer, Prime
-   Allow setting time range to auto enable/disable extension
