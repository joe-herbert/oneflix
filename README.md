Chrome extension to stop Netflix binging by only letting you watch one episode at a time

Firefox doesn't work - waiting on [`window.navigation`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/navigation#browser_compatibility) support.

To do:
- Install, update and uninstall pages on website
- Enable/disable with keyboard extension and button in extension popup
- Support for other streaming sites
